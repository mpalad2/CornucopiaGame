# CornucopiaGame
Group Project from Game Art - a visual novel/dating sim demo created using Ren'Py

This is a part of a group project for Fundamentals of Game Art in Spring 2022, which took place over the span of a month.
We created characters, backgrounds, and UI assets for a visual novel/dating sim concept, and I coded and implemented these materials into Ren'Py to create a demo.
This does not contain the full game, as the files are too large, but it does include the main scene scripts.
The game can be downloaded here: https://mpalad2.itch.io/cornucopia .
The group video presentation + demo gameplay can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/L-lLaqCVnAk .
